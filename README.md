# Restaurant-Management
A Simple demo project to use react and bootstrap with pagination and google maps

This project uses following Technologies.

1. ReactJS
2. NodeJS
3. ExpressJS
4. Mongodb
5. Jest

Please import the same sample mongod using the following link.

https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/import-data/

As mentioned in the link json data will have the following structure.

{
  "address": {
     "building": "1207",
     "coord": [ -72.856077, 10.848447 ],
     "street": "Mo Park Ave",
     "zipcode": "10432"
  },
  "borough": "Test",
  "cuisine": "Bake",
  "name": "Restaurant Shop",
  "restaurant_id": "12334"
}

We will try to use fake json api project in future. For now its needed to have a ctive mongodb instance running with this data.
Also We will try to use GraphQL
